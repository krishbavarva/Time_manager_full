# üìç Location Tracking Setup Guide

## Overview
The Clock In/Out feature includes location tracking to record where employees clock in and out. This helps verify employee attendance and location.

## How Location Works

### üéØ Primary Method: Browser GPS
The system first tries to use your device's GPS for precise location:
- **Accuracy**: High (typically 5-20 meters)
- **Requires**: Location permission in browser
- **Best for**: Mobile devices and laptops with GPS

### üåê Fallback Method: IP-Based Location
If GPS is unavailable, the system uses your IP address:
- **Accuracy**: Approximate (city-level)
- **Requires**: Internet connection
- **Best for**: Desktop computers without GPS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è No Location Available
If both methods fail, the system will proceed without location data.

## How to Enable Location Access

### For Google Chrome:
1. Click the üîí padlock icon in the address bar
2. Find "Location" in the permissions list
3. Change from "Block" to "Allow"
4. Refresh the page
5. When prompted "Allow [site] to access your location?", click **Allow**

### For Firefox:
1. Click the üîí padlock icon in the address bar
2. Click "Connection Secure" ‚Üí "More Information"
3. Go to "Permissions" tab
4. Find "Access Your Location"
5. Uncheck "Use Default" and select "Allow"
6. Refresh the page

### For Safari:
1. Go to Safari menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Websites
2. Click "Location" in the left sidebar
3. Find your website in the list
4. Change to "Allow"
5. Refresh the page

### For Mobile Browsers:
1. Go to device Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Browser (Chrome/Safari/etc.)
2. Tap "Permissions"
3. Enable "Location"
4. Also ensure location services are enabled in device settings

## Testing Location

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for these messages:
- ‚úÖ `Browser geolocation successful` - GPS working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `Using IP-based geolocation` - Fallback active
- ‚ùå `User denied geolocation permission` - Permission denied

### 2. Clock In and Check
After clocking in, check the clock-ins table:
- **"View Location"** link appears ‚Üí Location captured successfully
- **"No location data"** message ‚Üí Location not available

### 3. View on Map
Click "View Location" to see the exact coordinates on Google Maps.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Location not available"
**Solutions:**
1. Enable location permission in browser (see guides above)
2. Enable location services in device settings
3. Check if using HTTPS (required for GPS)
4. Try a different browser
5. Restart browser after granting permissions

### Issue: "Position unavailable"
**Solutions:**
1. Check if GPS is enabled on device
2. Move to an area with better GPS signal
3. Try near a window if indoors
4. Wait a few seconds and try again

### Issue: Showing wrong location
**Likely using IP-based location:**
- Shows city/region but not exact building
- This is normal for devices without GPS
- Location will be approximate but functional

### Issue: Permission prompt doesn't appear
**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Reset site permissions in browser settings
3. Try in incognito/private mode
4. Update browser to latest version

## Location Data Storage

### What's Stored:
- Latitude coordinate (e.g., 40.7128)
- Longitude coordinate (e.g., -74.0060)
- Timestamp of clock in/out

### What's NOT Stored:
- Street address
- Building name
- Personal location history outside clock in/out

### Privacy:
- Location is only captured during clock in/out
- Not tracked continuously
- Used only for attendance verification
- Can be viewed by user and admin

## For Admins

### Viewing Employee Locations:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. View clock-in records
3. Click "View Location" to see where employee clocked in
4. Use for attendance verification and remote work tracking

### Location Reports:
- Export clock-in data includes coordinates
- Can be used with mapping tools
- Helps identify work-from-home vs office attendance

## Technical Details

### Location Accuracy:
- **GPS (Browser)**: ¬±5-20 meters
- **IP-Based**: ¬±5-50 kilometers
